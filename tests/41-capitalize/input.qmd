# Introduction {#intro}

Acronyms can be set to upper case for both short name and long name: \acr[case=upper,capitalize=both]{ai}.

In upper case for only the short name: \acr[case=upper,capitalize=short,first_use]{ai}.

In upper case for only the long name: \acr[case=upper,capitalize=long,first_use]{ai}.

They can be set to lower case for both short name and long name: \acr[case=lower,capitalize=both]{RL}.

In lower case for only the short name: \acr[case=lower,capitalize=short,first_use]{RL}.

In lower case for only the long name: \acr[case=lower,capitalize=long,first_use]{RL}.

Or they can be set to sentence case for both short name and long name: \acr[case=sentence,capitalize=both]{mRNA}.
