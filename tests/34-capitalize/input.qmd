# Introduction {#intro}

\acr[capitalize]{RL} can be capitalized when the long name is in the beginning of a sentence.

On the other hand, \acr{AI} is not capitalized in the middle of a sentence.

{{< acr AI first_use=true capitalize=true >}} can also be capitalized when using shortcodes. 

\acr[capitalise=true, first_use=true]{RL} works when the British spelling of "capitalise" is used.

{{< acr RL first_use=true capitalise=true >}} shows that the British spelling also works with shortcodes.
